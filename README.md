## Running locally

Once Node 20+ is installed:

```
cd site
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at <http://localhost:4321>.

## Building for production

```
cd site
npm run build
```

The built static site lands in `dist/` — that's what gets deployed to GitHub Pages.

To preview the production build locally:

```
npm run preview
```

## How to edit content

### Editing a page's copy

Most page copy lives directly in the `.astro` file under `src/pages/`. Open the file in any text editor, change the text between the tags, save. The dev server will hot-reload automatically.

### Adding a library entry

Add a new `.md` file to `src/content/library/` using an existing entry as a template. The Library page reads all files in that folder automatically.

### Adding a case study

Same pattern — add a `.md` file to `src/content/case-studies/`.

### Changing the brand palette or typography

Edit `tailwind.config.mjs` (the source of truth) and `src/styles/global.css` (the CSS custom properties). Don't change these without updating `design-system/MASTER.md` first.

## Deploying

### To GitHub Pages

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**.
3. The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will build and deploy on every push to `main`.
4. The `public/CNAME` file tells GitHub Pages to serve the site at `possibleagriculture.com.au`.

### DNS

When DNS is ready, point:
- `www.possibleagriculture.com.au` CNAME → `<github-username>.github.io`
- Apex `possibleagriculture.com.au` A → GitHub Pages IPs (185.199.108.153 / .109.153 / .110.153 / .111.153)

Enable **Enforce HTTPS** in GitHub Pages settings after DNS is propagated.

## Content rules (always)

Every quantitative claim on the site must trace back to `/defensible-claims-register.md` in the parent folder. The design-system file at `design-system/MASTER.md` §13 lists the binding content rules — read it before editing.
